# StoSpecRep

Spectral representation for stochastic processes

## Introduction

what is EPSD bla bla (evolutionary power spectral density) ...


## Installation

```bash
pip install stospecrep
```
## Functionality
A convenience module mainly for:
1. Formulating EPSD  models;
2. Implementing **S**petral **R**epresentation **M**ethod given EPSD;
3. Estimating EPSD or PSD from realizations via [wavelet transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_transform);

*A practical introduction to Wavelet transform (morlet) can be found in xx*

## An example with Kanai-Tajimi model
